Flux is a auto WIFI CRACKER to test your one wifi. Simple Easy to use fast 
FLux is a remake of linset by v496, with more functions, and less Bugs

With Installer 

#How it works

* Scan the networks.
* Capture handshake (can be used without handshake)
* Use WEB Interface *
* Mounts one FakeAP imitating the original
* A DHCP server is created on FakeAP
* It creates a DNS server to redirect all requests to the Host
* The web server with the selected interface is launched
* The mechanism is launched to check the validity of the passwords that will be introduced
* It deauthentificate all users of the network, hoping to connect to FakeAP and enter the password.
* The attack will stop after the correct password checking
